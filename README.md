INTRODUCTION

1.1	Introduction

Education has always been a guiding principle in developing a nation. It is, therefore, very important that the various components of the education system are focused on developing the country's educational capabilities. This concept is also related to the development of the spiritual aspect (OECD, 2018). The direction and structure of the education system in Malaysia can be seen to be constantly evolving (RH Ahmad, 2017). It can be seen starting with the establishment of the Education Act of 1957, which was the basis for the country's independence (MOE, 2020). This formal education system begins with preschool, elementary, and secondary education. A variety of secondary schools and universities then support the system.

1.1.2 Historical Background of Higher Education in Malaysia

The historical development of higher education in Malaysia has been marked by significant milestones and reforms that have shaped the country's tertiary education landscape. The origins of formal education in Malaysia can be traced back to the establishment of schools by various colonial powers, including the British, Dutch, and Portuguese (Abelha et al., 2020). However, it was during the post-independence period that higher education institutions began to take shape. One of the key milestones in the development of higher education in Malaysia was establishment of the University of Malaya in 1949. As the first university in the country, it played a crucial role in providing higher education opportunities to Malaysians and was initially focused on arts, science, and medicine (Acosta Castellanos & Queiruga-Dios, 2021). Subsequently, other universities were established, including Universiti Sains Malaysia, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, and Universiti Putra Malaysia.

In the 1970s, Malaysia introduced a comprehensive reform agenda in higher education called the National Higher Education Plan. This plan aimed to expand access to higher education, improve quality, and ensure the relevance of academic programs to the country's socio-economic needs. As a result, polytechnics and community colleges were established to offer technical and vocational education, thereby diversifying the higher education landscape. Higher education in Malaysia has been pivotal in socio-economic development (Chung et al., 2020). It has been recognized as a human capital development and economic growth catalyst. The emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields has been crucial in advancing Malaysia's aspirations to become a knowledge-based economy. Additionally, higher education has contributed to social mobility by providing opportunities for individuals to acquire skills and knowledge necessary for better employment prospects.

1.1.3 Structure and Governance of Higher Education

The Ministry of Higher Education primarily guides the organizational structure and governance of higher education institutions in Malaysia. The ministry plays a central role in formulating policies, regulating the sector, and ensuring the country's overall development and coordination of higher education. It is responsible for setting strategic directions and providing funding support to universities and colleges. At the university level, the governance structure typically involves a Vice-Chancellor or President overseeing the institution's overall administration and academic affairs (de Wit & Altbach, 2020). Universities' respective senates are responsible for academic governance, curriculum development, and quality assurance. The Senate comprises academic staff, student representatives, and external experts.

Another key stakeholder in the governance of higher education institutions is the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA). The MQA is responsible for quality assurance and accreditation of academic programs offered by higher education institutions in Malaysia. It ensures that universities and colleges adhere to set standards and benchmarks, promoting quality education. Furthermore, regulatory bodies such as the Malaysian Examinations Council and the Malaysian Qualifications Register Council play vital roles in ensuring the standardization and recognition of qualifications. They facilitate the comparability and transferability of qualifications within Malaysia and internationally.

However, throughout this decade, various parties have debated the quality of higher education in Malaysia. One of the most common issues is that graduates are less successful in finding work after their degrees (Norliza Mohd Zain et al., 2018). The substantial impact that Universities have on a country’s social and economic development means that Universities need to have processes to continually improve quality and sustain the strength of their contribution. Universities contribute to a country’s advancement by preparing students for their role in society upon graduation.
